# Product Context: DOMulator

## Why This Project Exists
The primary motivation for DOMulator is to address the significant drawbacks of traditional headless browser testing:
- **Slowness**: Headless browsers are notoriously slow, leading to long test suites and hindering rapid development cycles.
- **Resource Intensity**: They consume substantial CPU and memory, making them impractical for large-scale CI/CD environments.
- **Setup Complexity**: Setting up and maintaining headless browser environments can be cumbersome and error-prone.

## Problems It Solves
DOMulator aims to solve these problems by providing:
- **High-Speed Testing**: By emulating the DOM and JavaScript runtime directly in Go, tests can run orders of magnitude faster.
- **Lightweight Footprint**: Eliminating the need for a full browser engine drastically reduces resource consumption.
- **Simplified Integration**: As a pure Go library, it integrates seamlessly into existing Go projects without external dependencies or complex configurations.
- **Reliable Automation**: Offers a stable and predictable environment for automated testing, free from browser-specific quirks or flakiness.

## How It Should Work
DOMulator should function as a drop-in testing solution for Go developers, allowing them to:
- Load HTML content (from strings or files).
- Execute JavaScript code (from strings, files, or URLs).
- Simulate user interactions (clicks, typing, form submissions, etc.).
- Assert on DOM state, text content, attributes, and visibility.
- Mock network requests to control API responses during tests.
- Debug JavaScript execution and inspect DOM snapshots.

## User Experience Goals
- **Familiarity**: The API should feel natural to Go developers, leveraging Go's idioms while mirroring browser DOM APIs where appropriate.
- **Efficiency**: Enable developers to write and run tests quickly, providing immediate feedback.
- **Reliability**: Ensure tests are consistent and deterministic, reducing false positives or negatives.
- **Extensibility**: Allow for easy addition of custom browser APIs or behaviors through a plugin system.
