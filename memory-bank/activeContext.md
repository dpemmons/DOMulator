# Active Context: DOMulator Development

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on the initial setup and foundational development of the DOMulator library. This involves translating the architectural design and specifications into a working codebase.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) to establish a comprehensive project context.
- **Documentation Cleanup**: Cleaned up README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md to remove fake performance benchmarks, fix markdown formatting, update placeholder URLs, and standardize code block formatting.
- **Repository URL Update**: Updated all instances of the placeholder repository URL (`github.com/example/domulator`) to the correct one (`github.com/dpemmons/DOMulator`).

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps involve setting up the basic Go project structure and beginning implementation of the foundational layers as outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.

### Detailed Breakdown of Next Steps:
1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Create the main `domulator` module.
   - Set up the initial directory structure (e.g., `internal/dom`, `internal/js`, `internal/parser`, etc.).

2. **Foundation Layer Implementation**:
   - **HTML Parser (`internal/parser`)**: Implement the HTML parsing logic using `golang.org/x/net/html` to convert HTML input into a token stream and then into a basic DOM structure.
   - **CSS Selectors (`internal/css`)**: Integrate `PuerkitoBio/goquery` for robust CSS selector parsing and matching capabilities.
   - **Event Loop (`internal/loop`)**: Begin implementing the core event loop mechanism to handle asynchronous operations, timers, and microtasks.

3. **DOM Core Implementation (`internal/dom`)**:
   - Define core DOM interfaces and structs (e.g., `Node`, `Element`, `Document`).
   - Implement basic DOM manipulation methods (e.g., `AppendChild`, `RemoveChild`).
   - Establish the foundation for mutation tracking.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Implementation Order**: Prioritizing foundational components (parser, basic DOM, event loop) before integrating the JavaScript runtime.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Adopt a TDD approach where possible, writing tests for each component as it's built.
- **Performance First**: Continuously keep performance targets in mind during implementation, opting for efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- DOMulator is a greenfield project with a well-defined architecture, but no existing code. This provides a clean slate but also a significant development effort.
- The success hinges on accurate and performant emulation of browser behaviors, particularly the DOM and JavaScript event loop.
