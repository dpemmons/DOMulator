# Project Brief: DOMulator

## Core Mission
To build DOMulator from scratch: a fast, lightweight, pure Go library for DOM emulation and JavaScript runtime, specifically designed for testing web applications.

## Key Value Propositions
- **Performance**: Achieve 100-1000x faster test execution compared to headless browsers.
- **Pure Go**: No CGO, no external dependencies, ensuring easy integration and deployment within Go projects.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Capable of running real JavaScript frameworks like HTMX, Alpine.js, React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript without modifications.
- **Built for Testing**: Provide a comprehensive suite of testing utilities, assertions, mocking capabilities, and debugging tools.

## Target Use Cases
- Developers needing to test front-end logic and interactions in Go.
- CI/CD pipelines requiring rapid and reliable web application testing without browser overhead.
- Projects utilizing modern JavaScript frameworks that need a lightweight, programmatic DOM environment.

## Scope
The project encompasses the development of a complete DOM emulation library, including:
- A full DOM API implementation.
- An integrated JavaScript runtime (Goja-based).
- A robust test harness with interaction simulation and assertion capabilities.
- Comprehensive network mocking for HTTP requests.
- A plugin system for extending browser APIs.
