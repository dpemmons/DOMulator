# DOMulator Progress Tracking

## Current Status: 🟢 Active Development

### Recently Completed ✅

#### ParentNode Mixin Specification Compliance (2025-06-04)
**Completed full specification-compliant implementation of WHATWG DOM Standard Section 4.2.6**

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Convert Nodes Into Node Algorithm**: Implemented the exact specification algorithm per steps 1-4
  - Null initialization, string-to-Text conversion, single node vs DocumentFragment logic
  - Proper handling of empty inputs, mixed node types, and invalid inputs
- **ParentNode Mixin Interface**: All properties and methods fully compliant
  - `children`: HTMLCollection of element children only (live collection)
  - `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, `childElementCount`: Element-specific navigation
  - `prepend()`, `append()`, `replaceChildren()`: Node insertion with string conversion
  - `moveBefore()`: State-preserving node movement per specification
  - `querySelector()`, `querySelectorAll()`: CSS selector support with proper scope-match
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed InsertBefore method logic for moving nodes within same parent
  - Proper index adjustment when moving from earlier to later positions
  - No-op optimization when node is already immediately before reference
  - Correct handling of self-reference scenarios in moveBefore operations
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: All ParentNode tests now validate exact specification behavior
  - Fixed TestNodeInsertBefore to correctly test DOM specification requirements
  - Comprehensive edge case coverage including DocumentFragment handling
  - All 138 DOM tests now passing with full specification compliance

**Technical Changes:**
- Implemented exact "converting nodes into a node" algorithm per WHATWG DOM spec
- Added proper HierarchyRequestError DOMException handling for all insertion methods
- Enhanced MoveBefore method with correct reference child handling
- Fixed InsertBefore index calculation bug that affected node movement within same parent
- All ParentNode mixin methods now follow specification steps exactly
- Comprehensive test coverage for all specification requirements and edge cases

**Specification Compliance:**
✅ ParentNode mixin interface fully implemented per WHATWG DOM Standard
✅ Convert nodes algorithm matches specification steps exactly
✅ All insertion methods properly handle string conversion and DocumentFragment creation
✅ MoveBefore preserves node state and handles all edge cases correctly
✅ CSS selector support through querySelector/querySelectorAll integration
✅ Live HTMLCollection behavior for children property
✅ Proper error handling with HierarchyRequestError DOMExceptions
✅ Full test coverage including specification compliance validation

#### NonElementParentNode Mixin Implementation (2025-01-06)
**Completed specification-compliant implementation of WHATWG DOM Standard Section 4.2.4**

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **GetElementById Method**: Implemented the NonElementParentNode mixin for both Document and DocumentFragment
- **Tree Order Traversal**: Correctly implements depth-first search to find first element in tree order
- **Specification Compliance**: Returns first element with matching ID, or null if none found
- **Descendants Only**: Properly searches only within descendants, not the parent node itself
- **Recursive Algorithm**: Replaced inefficient Traverse-based approach with optimized recursive search
- **Early Termination**: Properly stops traversal when first match is found (critical for duplicate IDs)

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `GetElementById(id string) *Element` method to DocumentFragment
- Added `findElementByIdRecursive(id string) *Element` helper method to both Element and DocumentFragment
- Ensures proper tree order traversal and early termination on first match
- Web compatibility maintained - getElementById not exposed on Element nodes per specification
- Comprehensive test suite covering all specification requirements

**Specification Compliance:**
✅ NonElementParentNode mixin interface implemented
✅ Tree order traversal correctly prioritizes depth-first search
✅ Duplicate ID handling returns first element found
✅ Empty ID strings properly handled (return null)
✅ Non-existent IDs properly handled (return null)
✅ Web compatibility constraints respected
✅ Full test coverage including edge cases

#### DOM Node Tree Specification Compliance (2025-01-06)
**Completed comprehensive implementation of DOM Living Standard Section 4.2 - Node Tree requirements**

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Node Length Method**: Added `Length()` method to Node interface that correctly returns:
  - 0 for DocumentType and Attr nodes
  - Character data length (in Unicode code points) for Text, Comment, ProcessingInstruction nodes
  - Number of children for Document, Element, DocumentFragment nodes
- **IsEmpty Method**: Added `IsEmpty()` method that returns true when node length is 0
- **Hierarchy Validation**: Enhanced tree constraint validation to enforce DOM specification rules:
  - Document can only have one Element child and one DocumentType child
  - DocumentType, Text, Comment, ProcessingInstruction, Attr nodes cannot have children
  - Elements can contain Elements, Text, Comments, ProcessingInstructions but not DocumentType or Document nodes
  - Circular reference prevention
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests covering all specification requirements:
  - Node length calculations for all node types
  - Empty node detection
  - Document child ordering constraints
  - Node type hierarchical restrictions
  - Valid document structure validation

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated Node interface to include Length() and IsEmpty() methods
- Implemented methods in nodeImpl base class with proper type-specific logic
- Enhanced validateHierarchy methods to enforce DOM specification constraints
- Added Unicode-aware character counting for CharacterData nodes
- All existing functionality preserved - no breaking changes

**Specification Compliance:**
✅ Node length calculation per DOM spec
✅ Empty node detection
✅ Document tree constraints
✅ Node hierarchy validation
✅ Circular reference prevention
✅ All node types properly constrained
