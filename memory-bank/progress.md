# Progress: DOMulator Development

## What Works
- **Architectural Design**: A comprehensive and layered architecture for DOMulator has been defined, covering all major components from HTML parsing to the JavaScript runtime and testing harness.
- **API Specification**: The intended API for DOMulator, including test utilities, interactions, assertions, and network mocking, has been outlined in the `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Memory Bank Initialized**: The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created, establishing a foundational context for future development.

## What's Left to Build
Essentially, the entire codebase for DOMulator needs to be built from scratch. This is a greenfield project with no existing implementation. Key areas include:
- **Foundation Layer**: HTML Parser, CSS Selectors, Event Loop.
- **DOM Core**: Full DOM API implementation (Nodes, Elements, Document, Events, Mutations).
- **JavaScript Runtime Integration**: Binding Goja to the DOM, implementing browser APIs (Fetch, XHR, Timers, Storage, Console), polyfills, and module loading.
- **Test Harness**: Developing the high-level testing utilities, assertion system, interaction simulation, and network mocking.
- **Plugin System**: Implementing the extensibility mechanism for custom browser APIs.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implementing object pooling, lazy loading, caching, and other optimizations as development progresses.
- **Security Considerations**: Addressing JavaScript isolation and content security.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Pre-implementation / Initial Setup.
- **Readiness**: The project is ready to begin active coding based on the established design.

## Known Issues
- None, as no code has been written yet. Potential issues will arise during implementation and will be documented here.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The initial understanding was that DOMulator might be an existing project requiring modifications. This has been clarified: it is a completely new project, requiring full implementation from the ground up. This shift in understanding has been reflected in the `activeContext.md` and the detailed breakdown of next steps.
